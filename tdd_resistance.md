For over 20 years, Olgica played chess and spent the past 10 years in STEM, where she encountered various challenges.

From her earliest days in STEM, Olgica faced an array of challenges, navigating uncharted territories where psychological safety was lacking, health issues were rising, technical debt loomed, and unrealistic deadlines haunted even the most ambitious projects. But rather than accepting defeat, she embarked on a quest for solutions. Determined to find the best tools, techniques, and paths to overcome these obstacles, Olgica ventured into uncharted territory, unearthing the secrets that would change and benefit not only herself but also her colleagues.

Through perseverance and dedication, Olgica developed an impressive array of strategies to combat the hurdles she encountered. Health issues, a lack of empathy, layoffs, anxiety, and stress stood no chance against her resourcefulness. Her focus is on methodologies such as pair and mob programming.

Imagine a world where programmers can fearlessly collaborate, innovate, and ideate without the burden of anxiety or stress. Picture a workplace where empathy, exploration, innovation, higher purpose, and fearless, laser-focused action are the foundation, fostering creativity and unleashing the full potential of every team member. That’s the world Olgica envisions.

Today, Olgica proudly holds and creates through several impactful roles – a CPQC Coach (Certified Positive Intelligence Coach), a Software Engineer, and a Technical Agile Coach. In parallel, Olgica explores the world of Reiki.

“In today’s rapidly changing world, it is inevitable that we must return to ourselves rather than escaping through work. This is the key to unlocking and realizing our full potential.”<!-- endInclude -->
